Hello,I have completed homework 4 and uploaded all the required homework files in hw4 folder.
The image for hello file is also stored, I assume I have provided the right path this time, if not then plese refer to screenshot provided as I have faced this
difficulty in my previous Homework as well, because no matter what path I provide GIT messes it up and doesnt picks up the image.
All the requird screenshots are in a seprate folder for your easy access.
Please have a look and let me know if you have any issues in accessing them. Thank you for your help and support.
