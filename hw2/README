Hello, I have completed homework 2 and uploaded all the required homework files in hw2 folder. Please have a look and let me know if you have any issues 
in accessing them. Moreover I have updated the images path in my HTML files because in last submission I just gave my local machine path, 
also I have updated the required table <thead> and <tbody> tag after reading your response from homework 1.
Thank you for your help and support.
